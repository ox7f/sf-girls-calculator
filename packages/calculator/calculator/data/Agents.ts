  Tyrla spent her childhood in the Santriel Underground City (SUC), and life there was far from ideal. The living conditions in the SUC were unfavorable. To support herself and work towards curing her sister, she turned to dancing as her means of income.
  Through relentless dedication, Tyrla combined her dancing abilities with her combat skills, creating her own unique style of combat dance. Over the years, her combat dance evolved into a lethal yet elegant art form. Despite her success, Tyrla continues to perform in the SUC while also recently joining the Trajectory Academic Parliament. Her goal is to acquire more knowledge and save enough money to cure her sister's illness.
